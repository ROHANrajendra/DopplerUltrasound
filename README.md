# DopplerUltrasound
Processing the audio signal from a Handheld Doppler Ultrasound scan device to study the volumetric flow of blood by reading the spectral information of the signal.

Doppler Ultrasound Scan is read as an audio file. 
The spectrogram of the audio is taken to analyse. 
Appropriate filters are applied on the signal to reduce unnecessary noise and other components. 
Weiner filter is studied and implemented. 
There are certain features in the spectrogram that are observed and used to correlate the velocity of blood flow. 
The velocity and frequency is proportional to the vessel size. 
A healthier vessel is identified by comparing the graphs.
